# Enigma

### Functionality:(3)

I have successfully implemented the command like interface with the encrypt and decrypt methods. I have made several attempts at the cracking method, but was unsuccessful. I left a comment of my best attempt in the enigma.rb class.

### OOP:(3)

My project is broken out into logical components with two classes. The required enigma class which holds the encrypt and decrypt methods and all the helper methods required to compled those functionalities, and a shift class that transforms a key and date into a useable shift. The reason I did not get a 4 was because I did not implement a module nor inheritance. 

### Conventions and Mechanics: (3)

All of my variable naming is well chosen and will help a new reader understand my code easier. I can explain why I chose all my enumerables and why those are the best for the job. I have at least one hash implemented that makes logical sense.  The reason I did not get a 4 was because I have one class that is 12 lines long.

### TDD:(4)

I have tested all edge cases that I can think of for each method. All my helper methods have their own tests, and I have implemented stubs in a logical manner. Lastly my overall test coverage shows 100%.

### Version Control:(3)

While I have 5 pull requests and I have made detailed comments both in line and in my pull request I only have 36 commits. Since that is 4 commits short of getting a 4 I earned a 3. All of my commits and pull requests are in a logical fashion and properly named.
